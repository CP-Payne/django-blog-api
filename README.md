Blog API

// Working on it...

Future Todo:

- Users should be able to add custom tags

  - Tags should have a flag to determine whether a user created it or not

- User/Author should be able to choose between username and name to be displayed on blog and messages
- Implement blog search functionality
- Add ability to delete blog

- Implement Alias for comments

- Error message not correct when token is not provided (Custom Permissions Only)

- Add ability to choose which subscriptions/subscribers to view (Active/in-active)

# Advanced TODO:

Real-time Notifications (Advanced)

For a more dynamic user experience, consider integrating real-time notifications using WebSockets with Django Channels or a service like Pusher. This allows notifications to be pushed to users without requiring a page refresh.
